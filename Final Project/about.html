      <p class="abt-p1">After Steve Jobs' departure from Apple in 1985, the reins of product development were handed
         over to Jean-Louis Gassée, a former manager of Apple at France. Under his leadership, Apple's product strategy
         underwent a transformation marked by two key directions: increased "openness" in terms of expandability and
         interoperability, and a deliberate shift towards higher pricing.</p>

      </figure>

      <p class="abt-p2"> Gassée's strategy diverged from pursuing the low end of the computer market, where profit
         margins were slim. Instead, he championed concentrating on the higher end, where the potential for greater
         profit margins existed. He illustrated this concept using a graph that mapped the price/performance ratio of
         computers, positioning low-power, low-cost machines in the lower left and high-power, high-cost machines in the
         upper right. This approach was encapsulated by the memorable "high-right" mantra, which became a guiding
         principle for Apple's upper management.</p>

      <p class="abt-p3"> In retrospect, the intertwined stories of Steve Jobs and Jean-Louis Gassée underscore the complex journey of Apple during pivotal periods in its history. Steve Jobs' departure in 1985 and his triumphant return in 1997 epitomize the company's rollercoaster ride, from early innovation to subsequent struggles and, ultimately, to a renaissance. His visionary leadership and penchant for disruptive design not only saved Apple from the brink but propelled it to become one of the most valuable and influential technology companies in the world. On the other hand, Jean-Louis Gassée's contributions exemplify the dedication to craftsmanship and product excellence that defined Apple's early ethos. His role in expanding and refining the Macintosh line laid a foundation for the company's design-focused approach. The narratives of these two individuals are woven into the fabric of Apple's identity, symbolizing the resilience, creativity, and visionary spirit that continue to define the company's legacy.</p>
